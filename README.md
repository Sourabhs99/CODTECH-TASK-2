## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

**Project**:**STUDENT GRADE TRACKER**
## Objective
To create a simple student grade tracker that calculates the average grade, assigns a letter grade, and computes the GPA based on user-input grades.

### Key Activities
Define Grade Calculation Functions:
calculate_letter_grade: Determines the letter grade based on the average score.
calculate_gpa: Converts the average score into a GPA value.
Input Grades:
input_grades: Collects a list of grades from user input, allowing the user to type 'done' to finish.
Calculate Average:
calculate_average: Computes the average of the grades entered.
Display Results:
main: Coordinates the process, including collecting grades, calculating average, letter grade, and GPA, and displaying the results.

### Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to implement the grade tracker.
Basic Input/Output Operations: For user interaction and displaying results.
### Key Insights
Error Handling: Utilizes try-except blocks to handle non-numeric inputs when entering grades.
User Interaction: Provides a simple command-line interface for entering grades and viewing results.
Modularity: Functions are organized to handle specific tasks (e.g., calculating grades, collecting input), making the code easier to manage and understand.
Division by Zero: Avoided by checking if the list of grades is empty before calculating the average.

This program is a practical example of handling user input, performing calculations, and presenting results in Python. It also demonstrates basic error handling and user-friendly interaction through the command line.
